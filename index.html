        <p> Ravenclaw is one of the 4 Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
        It was founded by Rowena Ravenclaw. Rowena was a scottish witch and one of the four founders of Hogwarts schools.
        She was noted for her intelligence and creativity as well. The head of the House is Filius Flitwick.
        Filius Flitwick is a part-goblin wizard who had attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
        Some time after his graduation he returned to Hogwarts and became the Charms Master as well as head of Ravenclaw House.
        The members of the House are characterized by their wit, learning and wisdom. Their symbol corresponds to the element of air,
        this is because the blue and bronze represented the sky and eagle feathers, both of these colors represent the element of air. </p>
